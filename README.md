# One-Neural-Network-for-Multiple-Purposes
This repository contains code for a neural network model that is trained once and is used for 4 different tasks successfully. Here we train a single model, which is used for captioning images, inferring images from a caption, finding similar words from a given word and finding similar images from given image.
